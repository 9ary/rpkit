pico sdk init flow:

- reset all peripherals but QSPI pads and IO bank, PLLs
- pull peripherals clocked by clk_ref and clk_sys out of reset
- call early init routines
- initialize the entire clock tree
- pull everything else out of reset
- disable inputs on pads that are not broken out
- initialize mutexes (????)
- copy vector table to RAM
- configure the MPU for stack overflow protection
- reset spinlocks
- set up IRQ priorities
- initialize alarm pool (?)
- run constructors (C++?)
